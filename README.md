# My skills

This project demonstrates my progress in Python programming and showcases various programming concepts, including arithmetic operations, string manipulation, boolean logic, and data structure handling (lists, tuples, and dictionaries).

## Features
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (with error handling), and exponentiation.
- **String Manipulation**: Replace negative words in a sentence with positive alternatives randomly selected from a predefined list.
- **Boolean Logic**: Simple simulation of weather conditions affecting activities.
- **Data Structures**: Operations on lists, tuples, and dictionaries, including appending, replacing items, and displaying student grades.
